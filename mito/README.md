# Mitochondria stuff

This is an example for a spot-fix to annotat a rhesus using the human mitochondria genbank annotation (included).

This could be generalized by pointing to and downloading a species' mitochondria sequence, running mitofinder.sh, then appending the mitochondria fasta and gtf to the genomic fasta and gtf.
